Fill in B01, B02, B03 and B04 to complete the reverse function which takes in a head to the head of a linked list and 
    returns a new copy of the linked list in reverse order.
You must allocate space for the new linked list that you return. An (incomplete) example program using reverse is also shown below.
*/

/*
You shall provide the functioned implementations. B01 is a declaration for function parameter. B02, B03, and B04 are C expressions.
You must obey the following rules when filling them:
- Write shorter code as possible as you can.
- Do necessary casting to eliminate compilation warnings.
- Follow the consistent coding style. That is, we prefer struct list_node *h to struct list_node* h. Be aware of the spaces! Details determine success or failure.
